# ONVIFSENSE---Final-Year-Project
Onvifsense is a central node application that facilitates the video streaming and feature discovery among devices. 
To ensure interoperability among devices, irrespective of their manufacturers I used profile S of ONVIF standards. 
I used disjoint sets to determine connected devices in the graph and dfs bfs for path finding.
